The sensor I'll choose is the acceloration sesnor. This can be used in "if" blocks to have alternate commands based on the acceleration of the sphero. This can be increased by;tossing the sphero, rolling it faster, or even carrying it around.
As stated prior, this can be placed in "If" blocks, so you could say something along the lines of. "if accelorometer>2, then play random animal noise."

I have a 0 for an assignment in this class because of a miscommunication error on my end. I beleive I put the wrong username in the Google email, and that might be the cause of this 0 in the gradebook.

Coding is an art form that can be picked up easily but difficult to master because it requires a listening ear and an attentive mind to understand. IF your aren't precise with your coding, you can end up with a syntax error or other form of error code that stops the program and your progress entirely. It's important to develop a good habit of listening attentivly so you can code efficiantly, and make bigger and bigger projects. And don't think about cutting corners, as if you do you can mess up the code beyond fixing.

Computer Science is an art found all around us, whether in the technology we use day-to-day, or in the features in class or work. On our person, we have a cell phone which has access to Google, the McDonalds app, and an oline article named, "Top 10 ways to make a cake." As a person who listens to music daily, the phone has access to my favorite artists and playlists with a tap of an icon. Without these devices like phones, and chromebooks, our technological world will probably crumble, as all have based their jobs on technology. For example, this prompt wouldn't be done, our canvas couldn't be opened, and the playlists on my phone would waste away. Computer Science is integral to the world, especially in this day and age.

Playtesters main job is to provide the developer feedback on any bugs or problems with a game. They use observation and screen recordings to make their testing more accurate, and with no real need for education, you could be a playtester straight out of high school. A playtester could eventually evolve into a developer, but besides that I don't really think I'd want to be a playtester mainly. I'd much rather prefer to make the games than play them.

Coding is as much an art of patience as it is an art of computer science, so when it comes down to it, all those syntax errors, division errors, and more are all testing your patience, and problem solving skills. And computer science is a rapidly expanding field, with jobs that once had no relation to technology, being reliant on it. So, knowing the fundementals of coding can help even if the field your in isn't directly related to technology. Coding can also increase your creativity, as the number of times you have to think of a new solution to a problem you had in the code will increase the ability to make new ideas. Along with probelm solving, creativity and collaberation are skills that will boost as you learn to code. Regardless of the field you choose, the ability to code is amazing and will boost many traits to the absolute maximum.

AI has the potential to make our lives easier, but can also destory our lives in a matter of seconds.
AI has many benefits, such as being able to make it's own, rational, choices. This can help make jobs easier with automation, and even being a helpful guide on the right decisions (if you trust a computer THAT much...) As well as being able to be transferred into a robot, to make physical choices as well, without sustaing much harm to the brain of the machine.
AI, however good the benefits are, can be extremely damaging. It's ability to make decisions for itself could make security a concern, as it could worm into your systems and leak it out. Also, AI could decide at any moment to just ditch an idea, the only thing stopping it being the call-and-response style of code we've made them have...

With the elections on the rise, technology an be a concern. Of course, we can't fully trust technology for everything, and if people found a way to hack into it, they could rig the ellection. However, the automation of the process means we will know whos president sooner, so theres some upsides I suppose.

A recent event in my life, an ongoing issue, has been my busy schedule. This has lead to some mental issues on my end, having to balance tennis, theatre, and my personal/school life. It felt like the weekends were consumed by my electives, but I got through it all thanks to problem solving, like that found in coding. In a sense, I guess you could say I debugged my life.

AI is a form of technology that has grown majorly during the 1950's, to the way we have it today. Nowadays, you can ask a computer, or websites such as ChatGPT, anything and they can come up with a clever response to any issue. AI truely is smart, so smart even, that it could help with coding. In coding, a lot of brainpower is used and you might need assistance trying to find a solution to your issue. AI could come up with about a million ways to fix the issue you have, and then some. A huge thing we need to keep in mind however, is that people could also use AI to try and get to places they shouldn't. We see it nowadays in high school, where people would cheat on a test by using AI websites to get answers. This is a problem we should try to fix sometime soon.
