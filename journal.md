The sensor I'll choose is the acceloration sesnor. This can be used in "if" blocks to have alternate commands based on the acceleration of the sphero. This can be increased by;tossing the sphero, rolling it faster, or even carrying it around.
As stated prior, this can be placed in "If" blocks, so you could say something along the lines of. "if accelorometer>2, then play random animal noise."

Coding is an art form that can be picked up easily but difficult to master because it requires a listening ear and an attentive mind to understand. IF your aren't precise with your coding, you can end up with a syntax error or other form of error code that stops the program and your progress entirely. It's important to develop a good habit of listening attentivly so you can code efficiantly, and make bigger and bigger projects. And don't think about cutting corners, as if you do you can mess up the code beyond fixing.

Computer Science is an art found all around us, whether in the technology we use day-to-day, or in the features in class or work. On our person, we have a cell phone which has access to Google, the McDonalds app, and an oline article named, "Top 10 ways to make a cake." As a person who listens to music daily, the phone has access to my favorite artists and playlists with a tap of an icon. Without these devices like phones, and chromebooks, our technological world will probably crumble, as all have based their jobs on technology. For example, this prompt wouldn't be done, our canvas couldn't be opened, and the playlists on my phone would waste away. Computer Science is integral to the world, especially in this day and age.

Playtesters main job is to provide the developer feedback on any bugs or problems with a game. They use observation and screen recordings to make their testing more accurate, and with no real need for education, you could be a playtester straight out of high school. A playtester could eventually evolve into a developer, but besides that I don't really think I'd want to be a playtester mainly. I'd much rather prefer to make the games than play them.

Coding is as much an art of patience as it is an art of computer science, so when it comes down to it, all those syntax errors, division errors, and more are all testing your patience, and problem solving skills. And computer science is a rapidly expanding field, with jobs that once had no relation to technology, being reliant on it. So, knowing the fundementals of coding can help even if the field your in isn't directly related to technology. Coding can also increase your creativity, as the number of times you have to think of a new solution to a problem you had in the code will increase the ability to make new ideas. Along with probelm solving, creativity and collaberation are skills that will boost as you learn to code. Regardless of the field you choose, the ability to code is amazing and will boost many traits to the absolute maximum.

AI has the potential to make our lives easier, but can also destory our lives in a matter of seconds.
AI has many benefits, such as being able to make it's own, rational, choices. This can help make jobs easier with automation, and even being a helpful guide on the right decisions (if you trust a computer THAT much...) As well as being able to be transferred into a robot, to make physical choices as well, without sustaing much harm to the brain of the machine.
AI, however good the benefits are, can be extremely damaging. It's ability to make decisions for itself could make security a concern, as it could worm into your systems and leak it out. Also, AI could decide at any moment to just ditch an idea, the only thing stopping it being the call-and-response style of code we've made them have...

With the elections on the rise, technology an be a concern. Of course, we can't fully trust technology for everything, and if people found a way to hack into it, they could rig the ellection. However, the automation of the process means we will know whos president sooner, so theres some upsides I suppose.

A recent event in my life, an ongoing issue, has been my busy schedule. This has lead to some mental issues on my end, having to balance tennis, theatre, and my personal/school life. It felt like the weekends were consumed by my electives, but I got through it all thanks to problem solving, like that found in coding. In a sense, I guess you could say I debugged my life.

AI is a form of technology that has grown majorly during the 1950's, to the way we have it today. Nowadays, you can ask a computer, or websites such as ChatGPT, anything and they can come up with a clever response to any issue. AI truely is smart, so smart even, that it could help with coding. In coding, a lot of brainpower is used and you might need assistance trying to find a solution to your issue. AI could come up with about a million ways to fix the issue you have, and then some. A huge thing we need to keep in mind however, is that people could also use AI to try and get to places they shouldn't. We see it nowadays in high school, where people would cheat on a test by using AI websites to get answers. This is a problem we should try to fix sometime soon.

I enjoyed the first semester very much in terms of coding. I enjoyed having the freedom to flourish at my own rate, allowing me to learn more in different periods of time and even using different sources on my journey to succeed in the coding career. I would most like to work on my python skills even further, as I'd like to be able to make games and other stuff with mimimum effort. The certificate I have my sights on right now is the PCEP certificate, or the "Python entry level certificate" which is proof of my mastery of the basics of the python language. Although I'd like to learn Java, C-Sharp, and other coding langauges to aquire their certificates and have the most versatility in my field of game design.

I feel that the growth of AI will severely hinder workers in many fields including tech. The sudden growth of AI can and will mess with jobs like art and coding, as AI can reproduce this as a whole. However, this coin does have two sides... the more AI grows, the more authenticity will be valued, as AI can't replicate humanities exact feelings and emotions while doing certain tasks. So, it could wipe out all of humanities originality, or it could make human work even more valuable. Quite a funny thing to think about, isn't it? This question isn't a simple 'Yes' or 'No' but instead a simple probability that could swing either way.

Language is a complex thing, with it being a barrier to some and an oppertunity to others. For people who interact with the new generation, such as teachers, counselers, and social workers, understanding the current slang can help forge bonds with their kids, or their clients. As of now, understanding slang is difficult, but not impossible, with tools such as the slang dictionary and more. 
However, it isnt as simple as "just learning" it. As with any language, being fluent and understanding are two completely different things, and in order to aid those with minimal mastery of the language, we should have a translator. But, of course, it's not as easy as that, as someone would have to keep the dictionary updated with all the current slang, while getting rid of the older, outdated words. As for whether or not teachers should teach appopriate slang, I believe not.  feel that slang, along with how you dress, act, and what you do, help convey who you are. Both to youself, and others whom you bless with your presence. Slang being as informal as it is allows for more character in the way one speaks, and that is something thats underappreciated. The lack of adults who understand todays slang can be both a blessing and a curse, as on one hand, it gives current teenagers or young children the exclusivity that we all want so dearly, but that exclusivity can cause rifts with day to day interactions with teachers and parents, as they could say something offensive to the current day. Like for example, way back when, the wrd "Gay" just meant happy. So when someone would say "That's so gay" it would mean something along the lines of being happy. But nowadays, its an insult. Alontg with some of todays slurs, which were commonplace a couple years ago. Slang, and olanguage as a whole, can prove to be a barrier, bu it also provides the exclusitvity that everyone desires... maybe it's a topic best left off the mortal tounge?

So to start this off, I want to set a stage here. In a 100v1, humans vs silverback gorilla, who would win? So I want to say that for the sake of things we will go with 50 woman and men from the U.S.A, and one silverback gorilla at the average weight. The humans remain unarmed, and the gorilla has their fists. A human male in the USA weighs about 200 lbs, and a woman comes in at 170 lbs. So the combined weight would be around the 18,500 lbs range for the human side. The gorilla cashes in at an astounding 430 lbs. Humans would outweigh the gorilla by 43 times, so it's not looking too good, or is it..? The gorillas only true predator is the leapord, and even then attacks are rare bacause of the gorillas huge size and strength. Nature itself is scared of it's creation, but what do humans have? Ultimately humans have brains in this battle, maybe able to attack from afar with rocks or split the attention of the gorilla, but the gorilla probably wouldn't fall for it. The only strength humans have is numbers here. They can't really climb away as the gorilla, if agitated enough, could still get you in a tree. And you have no weapons to try and kill the gorilla. And, a gorilla punch has the force strong enough to SHATTER a human skull. It's safe to say that, without divine intervention, the gorilla would win. Easily. This type of challange shouldn't go viral. It's reasons like these that our life expectancy is so low. But unfortunately, anyone stupid enough to risk their lives for fame will start a trend on social media. I mean, I'll direct you to the Tidepod challange.

I want to talk about the cell phone law, and why I think it's more of a hindrance than a benefit. So I want to discuss something first, about our recent strides toward improvement in special needs and accesibility overall. We recently have done many great things for people in the special needs department, such as an increase to money being sent towards this group. And this new law is a massive step back. As sad as it is, your phone has become an integral part of your life and it's really hard to just break off like that! To go from 100-0 is a horrible experience for anything. Think about a drug addict? Or a change in your sleep schedule. Not every good thing is easy to chop out of your schedule... And phones were important because they allowed the special needs kids certain tools, such as external stimulation via music or vibrations. This was important as some kids used their phone as a tool to improve their learning experience. Kids such as I. I used a phone to provide stimulation, as to keep my focus on important things such as class work. And with the new bill, my focus has been shattered as I have no way to get my auditory stimulation, and keep my focus. But enough about me and ultimately people society hates (as unfortunate as it is, our special needs kids don't get the love they deserve:C) Let's talk about people our government also strongly hates! Teachers... Our new law here has prevented teachers from a tool that enabled teaching. And safety. It's harder for teachers to communicate with students, such as on field trips. And, you can't let a group aware of plans. As a person in athletics, every day is a gamble because I have no clue if we were suppposed to meet in our room or on the courts. Whereas last year, I didn't have this problem because my coach couldve posted on SportsYou. But thanks to the new bill, and our chromebooks BLOCKING everything that isn't quizzes and kahoot, our ability to let others know of plans is tosses to the wayside. I could go on and on about this law, and the reasons it's stupid and does more harm than good, but it would do nothing. Our government wouldn't care if I slapped a paper on their desk or not. It would get discarded, just like the creations of their own making.

My dream careers include theatre, technical or acting, and game design. And luckily for me, I'm being trained in the area that dominates all others in today's society. Computer Science. Computer science is a field that is constantly growing with todays age. The age of technology has obvious benefits for those knowledgable in the art of computer science. Technical theater relies on computers, no kidding. So having the ability to program lights is useful in theater.

There's a major problem with the shutdown of SNAP, the most obvious being that it was a financial aid for those who couldn't afford healthy foods. Without this aid, people who couldn't afford it will find themselves resorting to one of two options. Eating unhealthy food, or worse non edibles. Such as rocks and dirt to avoid starvation, this will cause many problems with their digestive system and will in most cases lead to death. The second, worse option, is that they will go without food, and starve. This is horrible, because in either case they are left to suffer withoout healthy food. Technology might be a saving grace if they can access said technology. Online forums are always looking for ways to assist those less fortunate, such as funding food banks and running donations for the people who need it most. However, the big problem lies in that it's technology. This means that a person would need to get a phone, computer, or other way of accessing the internet, which poses a huge problem. If you don't have 20 dollars for a healthy thing of food, you definitly don't have 300+ dollars at cheapest for a phone or laptop. And people are much less generous when it comes to sharing their precious technology... An idea to help support these peoples, is an idea I'd like to call "insert name here cause I'm not creative..." and this program would have people pay a little bit more when they buy groceries in order to help support those less fortunate. Of course, not everyone can afford to carry the entirety of that weight in their wallets, so it'd be an optional 5% you can donate to a charity or other program to benefit those who don't have food.

This year was, an interesting one to be sure. But I'm grateful for the experiences I have gained both from school and friends. I've learned more about unity, being able to make some simple backgrounds and stuff with premade assets. I'm continuing to work on my unity abilities... But I also learned I have an interesting affinity with poetry, which is a path I never would have thought of previously!

I'm not looking forward to thanksgiving break... As a person who thinks a lot, arguably too much, I often times find myself thinking too far into things if I'm not forcibly ripped from the clouds, and when I'm on my own with my family, noone can slow me down. Thanks overthinking!

As a person who thinks AI should have its limits, Waymo and their automatic driving cars are... not safe. Software issues are something that happen to even the most sofisticated and refined programs have. A car that autoomaticaaly drives is something I'm 110% against. What happens if theres a bug and you're no longer able to seize control of the car? You're forced to watch as you ride off to who knows where, and end up possibly crashing. Technology is a tool, but it can't do everything for us yet. Maybe in the future, when we're more equipped, but for now I am against the idea of Waymo and their self driving cars.

My winter break was alright enough. I used technology a good bunch over break, whether it be to contact friends or to play games with my family. Alternatively, we also used technology such as the fridge almost daily, just to keep our food (namely the chili we made christmas eve...) cold and edible. Technology is so prevelent that even when I took a "no technology" day, I still ended up using the house alarm and other electronics around the house.

Autcraft was a "safe place" on the internet, of which there are few. But I propose we fix that! Developers of games, especially online games (whether it be free for all warfare, or a team based hero shooter, or any OTHER online game.) should be in charge of making these spaces. They as developers should prioritize the consumer, or customer, or whatever you wanna call em, and their safety. Developers know the ins and outs of their game, and should be able to keep toxicity away from the playerbase. Many examples of a good developer (in this regard-) can be found on the apple app store. A lot of these games you can install, such as LootFiend or Idle Slayer (just for example) have discord servers with moderators, for players to discuss builds and other various in game mechanics with eachother, and it's overall pretty friendly.

Humans are sheep, and our phones and acess to internet is the sheepdog. Technology and humans can mix together to create this megahorn effect, and if one person is strong willed enough, they'll find more people in their cause via the internet. Technology can create a more fair and just society if everyone works together. We all have a tool of mass destruction, reform, change, just sitting in the palms of our hands! These tools, our phones, are able to send messages from one end of the earth to the other in no time at all. This makes the spreading of information easy as pie, and allows people to spread word to make our world a more humane place for all of us.

Testing was fine. I think I did as well as I could, but no 'preparing' will help with that test, at least for me. It tends to be easier for me before I study and everything. (Kinda ironic buuut...) But I'm proud of what I did today, so I'm happy to be done testing.

Football, while I'm sure it's a fun sport to play, just isn't my cup of tea. I won't yuck anyone's yum, but it's just not for me. I don't like watching sports- even as a tennis player I only watch a couple tennis matches when I'm desperate to improve. And i'll watch mainly for form and other tips and tricks from the pros, not for the game itself. As such, I did not watch the superbowl, but I'm glad everyone else had fun with their superbowl parties and superbowl monday and whatever else!
