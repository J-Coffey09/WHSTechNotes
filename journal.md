The sensor I'll choose is the acceloration sesnor. This can be used in "if" blocks to have alternate commands based on the acceleration of the sphero. This can be increased by;tossing the sphero, rolling it faster, or even carrying it around.
As stated prior, this can be placed in "If" blocks, so you could say something along the lines of. "if accelorometer>2, then play random animal noise."

I have a 0 for an assignment in this class because of a miscommunication error on my end. I beleive I put the wrong username in the Google email, and that might be the cause of this 0 in the gradebook.

Coding is an art form that can be picked up easily but difficult to master because it requires a listening ear and an attentive mind to understand. IF your aren't precise with your coding, you can end up with a syntax error or other form of error code that stops the program and your progress entirely. It's important to develop a good habit of listening attentivly so you can code efficiantly, and make bigger and bigger projects. And don't think about cutting corners, as if you do you can mess up the code beyond fixing.

Computer Science is an art found all around us, whether in the technology we use day-to-day, or in the features in class or work. On our person, we have a cell phone which has access to Google, the McDonalds app, and an oline article named, "Top 10 ways to make a cake." As a person who listens to music daily, the phone has access to my favorite artists and playlists with a tap of an icon. Without these devices like phones, and chromebooks, our technological world will probably crumble, as all have based their jobs on technology. For example, this prompt wouldn't be done, our canvas couldn't be opened, and the playlists on my phone would waste away. Computer Science is integral to the world, especially in this day and age.

Playtesters main job is to provide the developer feedback on any bugs or problems with a game. They use observation and screen recordings to make their testing more accurate, and with no real need for education, you could be a playtester straight out of high school. A playtester could eventually evolve into a developer, but besides that I don't really think I'd want to be a playtester mainly. I'd much rather prefer to make the games than play them.

Coding is as much an art of patience as it is an art of computer science, so when it comes down to it, all those syntax errors, division errors, and more are all testing your patience, and problem solving skills. And computer science is a rapidly expanding field, with jobs that once had no relation to technology, being reliant on it. So, knowing the fundementals of coding can help even if the field your in isn't directly related to technology. Coding can also increase your creativity, as the number of times you have to think of a new solution to a problem you had in the code will increase the ability to make new ideas. Along with probelm solving, creativity and collaberation are skills that will boost as you learn to code. Regardless of the field you choose, the ability to code is amazing and will boost many traits to the absolute maximum.
